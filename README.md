## Leveraging R Markdown for Process Narratives
See `process narrative example.rmd` for an annotated template and the `.md` file to see what it will look like (it renders best as HTML).

### Abstract
R Markdown (RMD), while often used for data analysis, can be employed to create detailed narratives for ETL processes, to supplement data dictionaries, and in general to help analysts share and document their work. This poster will describe the process of consolidating disparate SQL queries and SPSS scripts used for creating survey weights and response rates into an R Markdown document with annotations describing each step in detail, and highlight advantages of this approach. 



## Unlocking Insights: Optimizing Your Text Data with Machine Learning
This session illustrates using structural topic modeling (STM) with open-ended questions on two [NSSE Topical Modules](https://nsse.indiana.edu/nsse/survey-instruments/topical-modules/index.html). As part of NSSE's IRB and agreement with partner institutions, student responses to these questions (comments) are not shared outside NSSE staff or the partner institutions to mitigate risk of exposing confidential information about students or university faculty or staff. As such, sample student comment data cannot be provided.

As an example, then, I conducted a similar analysis[LINK OR FORK] using public commentary on student debt relief. The text processing and analysis used there are virtually the same as used for this project.

### Abstract
Machine Learning techniques have played a pivotal role in revolutionizing textual data analysis. This session employs compelling case studies utilizing student responses to open-ended questions from two NSSE topical modules with a particular emphasis on the challenges of managing extensive datasets. Our session provides practical insights into automated text processing like topic modeling, clustering, and sentiment analysis. This transformative journey empowers researchers to harness the potential of Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), to unveil concealed patterns and derive actionable insights. As we navigate the complexities of qualitative analysis, participants will gain invaluable and tangible takeaways for their qualitative analysis techniques.
